'''
Implement a function called print_string_characters(word1: str, word2: str) -> None. It should print the characters of word1 separately, and then print the characters of word2 separately. Use the shorthand method to loop through each character in each word.

    my_string = word1 + word2
    for i in my_string:
        print(i)
