'''
Implement the two functions on the right as follows:

first_n_characters(s: str, n: int) -> str should return a string with the first n characters from s. You may assume that the length of s is greater than or equal to n.
last_n_characters(s: str, n: int) -> str should return a string with the last n characters from s. You may assume that the length of s is greater than or equal to n.
Hint: If we want the last 1 character from a string s, we would start at index = len(s) - 1. If we want the last 2 characters, we would start at index = len(s) - 2.
