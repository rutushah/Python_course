#Hi, in this python course, I am adding all the challenges given in the neetcode, why i solved while learning python.

# key points

- List in python are mutable, means we can change the existing list, without creating new list
- Tuples in python are immutable, means we cannot change the value of tuples, tuples are defined as (parenthesis)
